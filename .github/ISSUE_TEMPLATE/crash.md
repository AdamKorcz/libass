Please replace the following text with the appropiate information.

**libass version in use?**
If you encountered the crash on an old version of libass please retest with current git-master or the latest release if possible.

**Did you encounter the crash in earlier versions of libass?**
Or did everything work just fine before?

**System you encountered the crash on?**
OS:  *(\*Linux, MacOS, Windows, …)*
CPU: *(32 or 64Bit AMD/Intel x86, ARM, POWER, …)*

**Sample**
Please provide a sufficient sample to reproduce the crash.

At minimum this will be an excerpt of an ASS file; don't forget to also share the used Styles not only the Dialogue line. The excerpt should basically be a fully functional ASS file in itself. If you can’t make an excerpt, we can work with a full ASS file if you tell us the time at which the problem occurs.

If the issue is specific to a video file, please try to upload a short cut of it. Eg MKVToolNix allows you to make a smaller cut from a larger file.

**Include the font**
If a particular font is needed to trigger the crash, upload it as a file if you have permission to do so. If it is a free font available on the Web, you can instead give a link to it.

**Log**
If you have logs or a stack trace regarding the issue please include them. Eg for [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv), you can obtain a log by adding `--log-file=output.txt` when playing the affected file. A stacktrace or both are however even better.

**Anything else**
Feel free to add anything else that may be useful.
